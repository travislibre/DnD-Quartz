title: "The Lances of Roslair"
---

An adventuring party of True Hunters from [The Hunter's Lodge](The%20Hunter's%20Lodge.md) branch in Roslair, they were sent to investigate rumors of a plot to summon seawraiths to the village of Lhora, only to be tricked and sacrificed by the Cult of [The Predator](The%20Predator.md).

The party assumes the bodies and identities of the Lances following their sacrifice, due to the magical vacuum created by their sacrifice. The reason the party was summoned was due to the magical potential of their souls, being the highest on Earth.

The Dragonborn, Kregorach, was a relatively famous warrior, known for his unusual garb and impressive swordsmanship.
