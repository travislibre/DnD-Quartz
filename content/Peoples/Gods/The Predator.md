The Predator is a extraplanar eldritch horror, capable of swallowing entire universes whole into his "body"

The entity was the original target for the summoning ritual, but the ritual wasn't powerful enough to reach the entity itself, and was only able to reach the plane right above it: Earth.

The entity is referred to as "The Great Predator" in arcane texts when discussing it's universal appetite, leading to the misconception that the entity is a benevolent being, one which would devour the monsters that plague Terra.
