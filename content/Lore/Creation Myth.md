In the dawn of time, the Gods came from the North and brought land, water, plants, animals, and all life as we know it from their divine hands. As time went on, the Gods began to play with their creation, creating the Common races, and loved them dearly. The Common races blasphemed, however, and took upon the god's creations and made it their own. The Gods were enraged, and struck down the great towers of the blasphemers, and sent down the first Beasts to stop the Common races from ever reaching the same height again.
