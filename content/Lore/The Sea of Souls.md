title: "The Sea of Souls"
---

Upon dying, every mortal soul travels to the sea of souls, where the tide takes them to the central isle in the sea of souls, where the dead are ferried into the afterlife.

Souls are gathered in that central isle however, and some are used to power the veil that prevents travel into or out of the world except at the central isle.
