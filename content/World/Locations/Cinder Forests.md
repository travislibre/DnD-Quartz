## Cinder Forest
A huge forest betweem the city of [Dun Ard](Dun%20Ard.md) and [Lhora](Lhora.md), the Cinder Forests are a vast expanse of woods dominated by plantlife that coexists with and utilizes the natural fires that occur frequently within this region. Cinder trees have adapted to the sulfer and carbohydrate rich soil by evolving mana-infused, fire immune trunks and leaves. Cinder trees are hollow, and you can sometimes find holes or gashes on the trees exterior to see a flaming core of pit at the bottom of the trunk. The residual heat of Cinder Forest provides a unique source of energy for the plantlife here, with orange and char-black weeds and bushes littering the forest floor.



**Flare: **Rarely, the Cinder Forest will experience what is known as a where a huge section of the forest will combust spontaneously with little to no warning. For this reason, trips to the forest are rare, and when necessary, brief.

**Dragon's Breath:** Gusts of hot air blow out of the east, accompanied by wisps of flame. Dragon's breath has a 50% chance of igniting candles, torches, tinder, loose paper, and similar flammable objects.

**Incendiary Clouds:** Clouds of roiling smoke shot through with hot embers drift overhead, casting a fiery glow. Airborne creatures flying into an incendiary cloud cause it to ignite, dealing 4d6 points of fire damage (DC 18 Reflex save negates).
