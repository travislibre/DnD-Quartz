## Lhora
** As the mouth of the cave opens up, you all see the dim lights of a town draped by fog. Lhora is a coastal port-town, enclosed by tall cliffs and cool ocean shores. The miasmic smell of fish and fresh morning dew mixes and wafts its way to you through a cool ocean breeze, while you all hear the ringing of port bells and the clamor of fishers, preparing to disembark in the morning. **

Lhora is governed by the wives and widows of the townsfolk, with weekly meetings determining public policy. The Salt-wives are led by the Matriach, the oldest woman in the town, who does not vote but moderates debate and occasionally gives advice and wisdom. This democratic matriachy was formed out of necessity, as Lhora was once ravaged by seawraiths hundreds of years prior, with the town being reduced to only it's widows and children.

Lhora practices the Ilyric tradition, meaning the use of undead to perform menial labor is commonplace and accepted. Before dying, townsfolk can consent to allowing their body to be used for labor, and the town employs around 20 skeletons working full time, day and night, maintaining walls and farming.

	 - The center of government for Lhora, the Hall of the Salt-Wives is where the married women meet to discuss plans of expansion, policy, finances, trade, and defense. 
2) Temple to [Il≈∑r](Il%C5%B7r.md)
	 - A humble temple with a blue, tiled roof, supported by plain columns. The temple lacks a wall, and you can hear the whistling of the ocean breeze as it flows through the shrine, adorned with stone seashells.

5) The Tangy Trident Tavern
	-  Kaye, Kern, and Dorse are three young half children. They sit on one bench/booth together, each passing a glass of water between them. They're noticeably dirty, and between jokes periodically glance around. If approached they tell you their mom went out and will be back any minute. Their mom, Saleen, is a trader and left them here with an allowence thats beginning to run short.
6) Lhora Public Library
	- A quaint hut, with exactly one shelf of books. Nearly every single one of them is related to different types of fish, how to cook and prepare traditional meals, and different mariner related things. In the midst however, is a book 
7) [The Hunter's Lodge](The%20Hunter's%20Lodge.md)
	- One of the more refined buildings in town, the Hunter's Lodge has three gilded banners outside the entrance: an amethyst banner with a gold flame, and emerald banner with a golden spear behind a shield, and a ruby banner with a golden sword with cloth wrapped around it. The interior is a living room sized meeting hall, with rooms for travelling adventurers. Caelestia is the temporary Patron of Lhora, as they have been demoted from the Roslair's guild.

** Soul Fog: ** Lhora will sometimes have fog from the Sea of Souls snake through the town, during which magically attuned beings can hear the whisphers of the dead.
