title: "Roslair"
---

Roslair is a temple state built atop the body of a slumbering, migratory crab, south of [Lhora](Lhora.md), and bordering the central sea. Lhora is a huge, marble city, adorned with greenery and banners as far as the eye can see. All of this regality, however, hides a population living in extreme poverty and squallid conditions. With extreme population density due to the limited size of the walls, the city is often banishing it's residents, and the main job of the local Temple Guard is to enforce the border. Many are unable to secure passage into the city proper, and must eeke out a living on the outskirts, prey to occasional monster attacks


Roslair maintains it's safety through their patron crab-terrace, but hordes space viciously, making it near impossible to get into the city without triple stamped approval. Monsters avoid the space on an instictual level in order to avoid upsetting the city-sized crustacean, but view the outskirts as free game.
