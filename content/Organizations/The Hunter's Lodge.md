title: "The Hunter's Lodge"
---

The Hunter's Lodge is a supranational organization dedicated to the training, management, and appointment of Hunters, individuals dedicated to slaying the beasts, magical and mundane, that threaten the few surviving bastions of life on Terra. Without the Hunter's Lodge, the common races would have gone extinct long ago.

The Hunter's Lodge is goverened by the Assembly of Lodge-Masters, a shadow councils of hunters who remain anonymous, with the exception of the five Order Leaders.

Ranks:
1) Bait
	- The "in training" rank, normally used as fodder or bait outside of training
2) Exterminator
	- The most common rank, given to city guards, peace-keepers, and hunters of weak monsters
3) Scout Hunter (Level 1)
	- The highest most normal folk go, responsible for scouting the exterior of most cities and towns for beast-tracks to report on monster movements and sightings

4) True Hunters (Level 2-5)
	- An uncommon sight, Hunters are powerful enough to deserve a pay high enough to retire early and live comfortably. Responsible for hunting monsters capable of slaying trained men in full armor. 
	- Hunter's are allowed to choose their own contracts and place of living, but being inactive for too long will draw the ire of local governments and the Lodge.

5) Greater Hunter (Level 5-10)
	- A rare sight, Greater Hunters are veritable one man armies, powerful enough to take down an entire camp of humanoids. Greater hunters make prey of predators capable of killing an entire platoon of men.
	- Greater Hunter's are allowed to choose their place of work, but will have contracts assigned to them by the Lodge at least once a week. Greater Hunter's are no longer given the choice to resign, and refusal to aid in the defense of mankind will result in exile from both the Lodge and civilized society.

6) Elite Hunter (Level 10-15)
	- An exceedingly rare sight, Elite Hunters deal with monsters that endanger whole cities, and are often in charge of their local Order. Elites are usually the object of much respect, and in some cases, fear. Elite Hunters only take contracts that could threaten the lives of an entire party of Greater Hunters, and are otherwise usually involved in administration and training.
	- The same restrictions for Greater Hunters apply to Elites, but with the additional requirement that Elite Hunters reside in major urban centers, the rationale being that such valuable men cannot be wasted on lesser towns or villages.

7) Legend Hunter (Level 15-20)
	- Spoken of in hushed tones, Legends are the only ones who can go toe-to-toe with the continent-shattering class of monsters, and all cities must possess at least one in order for the people to feel safe. Unfortunately, the weight of the people's respect is all but crushing, with nobody daring to offend them, for any reason, ever. Legends are in charge of an entire cities Lodge and Orders, and are only ever superceded by the direct ruling by the Assembly.
	- Legends have no control over where they live, what contracts they take, and what Order they belong to. Legends are in such high demand that any city with more than one Legend will usually be sending one away soon, for trade or political reasons. Legends are afforded nearly every luxury that the world can offer, save for freedom and company.

8) Lodge-master (10-20)
	- The administrative higherups of the Hunter's Lodge, responsible for managing the general state of affairs and future of the Hunter's Lodge, ensuring their continued dominance and supremacy.
