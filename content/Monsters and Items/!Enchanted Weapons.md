# Null Blade
**DO NOT mention the curse TO ANYONE at the table. Acknowledging it out loud will have grave consequences.**

Item Rarity: Rare
Damage: 1d8+1 (1d10+1 when two-handed)
Damage Type: Slashing
Requires Attunement by a Fighter

Description: The Null Blade is an obsidian black katana, with roiling dark energy flowing across it's edge and a hilt wrapped in golden silk. Wielding the sword is addictive, and one's proclivity to violence is heightened while unsheathed.

Basic Properties: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. 

Determination: While you are attuned to this weapon, any time an attack which would permanently kill you in one shot strikes you, it instead reduces you to one hit point.

Subspace Maw (Reaction): The Null Blade can warp the universe to form a perfect counter to enemy strikes and consume the power behind them. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to slice open a tear in the fabric of reality and absorb the damage. This reaction counts as a magical effect, and can be counterspelled. You can only use this feature once per combat encounter.

Curse: **You cannot tell anyone about this curse.** The Null Blade is deeply cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the katana, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on all attack rolls made with weapons other than this one. Occasionally, you can hear the blade scream with enmity and hate. While the weapon is sheathed, you find your thoughts drift to violence and bloodshed uncomfortably easily. The blade demands discipline and perfection, and you must spend at least 30 minutes training with it each day. If you are able to, and you do not train with the weapon for at least 30 minutes, it might hurt you or an ally in your sleep, even potentially killing them. When you're falling asleep with this blade equipped, you swear you can hear another voice in your thoughts that isn't your own, speaking an unfamiliar language in a low, vengeful thrum.

If you have any questions about the curse, PM me, don't ask out loud at the table.

Charged Strike: Your next attack with the Null Blade can add the damage absorbed by Subspace Maw (Reaction) to its next damage roll as necrotic damage. 

Three Verse Slash: You can unsheathe your weapon faster than light can reach it, and the first attack you make in any encounter is made with advantage and crits on a nat 19 or nat 20.

# Executor's Gunblade
**DO NOT mention the curse at the table. Acknowledging it out loud will have grave consequences.**

Item Rarity: Rare
Blade: 1d6 Slashing, Finesse
Gun: 2d6 Piercing, reload 2, misfire 2, Range (25/60)
Requires Attunement by a Rogue

Description: The Gunblade is a highly unorthodox but highly effective fusion of old and new. A paradoxical firearm, the gunblade can only hold two shots at a time. Whatever magical property affecting the weapon causes the blade to feel weightless, allowing the weapon to be aimed and fired normally. Even stranger, the weapon can be holstered and quick-drawn like a normal pistol, the barrel and blade somehow collapsing and unfurling much like a telescope. To top it all off, the gunblade changes its appearance to match the user's wishes.

Basic Properties: This gun is a magic firearm that grants a +1 to attack rolls made with it, both melee and ranged. This does not include damage rolls.

Quickdraw: While the Executor's Gunblade is holstered, it's wary of everyone and everything around it, and you add your proficiency modifier to initiative rolls. Additionally, your FIRST attack in each encounter is done with advantage, and the range is temporarily increased to (60/120). 

Curse: **You cannot tell anyone about this curse.** The Executor's Gunblade is deeply cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the Gunblade, keeping it within reach at all times, even when sleeping. You have disadvantage on attack rolls with any other firearm. Finally, you feel a sense of dread build up within you if you go too long without scanning your surroundings for enemies. You cannot benefit from a long rest until you search your immediate surroundings for traps or enemies. While in unfamiliar situations, you can feel your paranoia creep up on you, and you swear you can hear panic-stricken thoughts not of your own mind.

If you have any questions about the curse, ask over discord, don't ask out loud at the table.

Bullet-Weaver: When attacking with this weapon, you may choose between using the blade or using the firearm, and may alternate when using multiple attack actions during the same turn (Such as with the *Extra Attack* feature). If you're in melee range, you may also choose to fire as you stab with the blade to make an additional attack roll against any creature in range, disregarding *Extra Attack* if you wish, but the misfire score increases to 5.

Deadeye: You crit on a 19 or 20, and the creature must make a Constitution Saving Throw (DC 10+Dex Mod) or be dazed and suffer disadvantage on its next attack.

# Trident of the Woodlands

**DO NOT mention the curse at the table. Acknowledging it out loud will have grave consequences.**

Item Rarity: Rare
Trident: 1d8 Piercing
Requires Attunement by a Druid

Description: The Trident of the Woodlands is a beautiful, near ornamental trident covered in moss. The prongs and body of the spear are gold, with flowering vines wrapped around the length of the prongs.

Properties: This trident can be wielded as a druidic focus that grants a +1 bonus to Attack rolls made with it. While holding it, you have a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. The trident has max 10 Charges for the following Properties. It regains 1d6+2 expended Charges every long rest. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 3 or lower, the trident will not gain new charges until you kill a sentient creature with it.

Spells: You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the trident's Charges to cast one of the following Spells from it, using your spell save DC: Animal Friendship (1 charge), locate animals or Plants (2 charges), Speak with Animals (1 charge), or speak with Plants (3 charges). 

Curse: **You cannot tell anyone about this curse.** The Trident of the Woodlands is deeply cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to sleep alone, and cannot benefit from a long rest unless within 10 feet of an ally. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and spell attack rolls if you've not made contact with an ally for more than a minute. Finally, you feel a sense of dread build up within you when you're not near allies. Sometimes, when you're alone, you think you can hear the Trident sob quietly. No one else hears this.

If you have any questions about the curse, DM me on insta, don't ask out loud at the table.

Bonus: You can also use an action to cast the Pass without Trace spell from the trident (1 charge), but must first physically consume a live animal or insect and draw a runic circle on the earth. This spell only works outdoors, and pauses while indoors or underground.
  
Tree Form: You can use an action to plant one end of the trident in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to transform the weapon into a healthy tree. The tree is 120 feet tall and has a 15-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 40-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of Transmutation magic if targeted by Detect Magic. The inside of the tree is hollow and furnished like a cozy cabin, with a soft tree-bark couch with cushions, five sheets that can be used as hammocks, and soft magic lights floating around that can be controlled at will. While touching the tree and using another action to speak its Command word, you return the trident to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a trident.
