### Session 1
*you feel a light tug at your head, and suddenly cant move forward. - 
You can't turn around, and infact, nothing seems to be moving.
The light tug you felt is slowly starting to feel more like head is being stretched off, and you feel searing pain as you feel a deep pain in you core from being dragged upward by this unknown force.
Something feels like it rips, and your vision starts to fly upward, you look down to see your body become a blip in the horizon as your soul is physically dragged through the heavens. You lose sight of the earth, and your vision becomes blurred with dark and purple shapes and colors, before you lose all consciousness and pass out

1) Zeke introduces his character, waking up in a tent fresh on the trail of an outlaw with a 10,000 dollar bounty, responsible for a spree of bank robberies. He's been chasing his prey ever since their robbery of a bank at New Brunwick. His prey is a family man turned bandit, who got into a string of bad investments and ended up turning to thievery. His target is somewhat of a legend, a people's folk hero and robin-hood esque character. He makes an investigation and nature check to follow his tracks, and follows his target into the town of San Anticado. There, he finds his horse tied up to a local bar, and can confront his target there. If he tries to kill him right away, it turns into a tavern shoot out, other wise it turns into a duel. If he loses the duel, his prey gets away and his soul is snatched, if he wins, he bounds him and his soul is snatched before he can collect the bounty.
