im gonna be starting a dnd campaign over winter break and I was wondering if you wanted to join

it's going to be an isekai-themed campaign set in a post-apocolypse world overrun with gigantic monsters, with conspiracy theories and secrets and lore. i've prepped this campaign over a few months so i have a bunch of neat homebrew stuff and custom maps and shit for the occasion, plus i have character sheets and dice if u need it. we'll be meeting at thompson's new house probably once a week in the afternoon for a few hours, depending on everyone's schedules.

if you dont think youd be able to do it its all good, but if it sounds like something youd wanna try lmk B]
