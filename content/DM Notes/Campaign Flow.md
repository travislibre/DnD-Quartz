## Introduction
### Session 1-2
1) Have the party do an intro sequence where walk us through their daily life, and sometime in the afternoon, collapse dead on the floor, their soul leaving their body
2) The party is summoned into a seaside cave by Cultists trying to summon [[The Predator]], with [[The Lances of Roslair]] bound to obelisks as sacrifices, their throats freshly cut.
	- The Cultists are trying to summon [[The Predator]] in order to destroy all monsters
2)  The party souls fly into the bodies of the adventuring party, the neck wounds healing before their eyes, leaving a permanent scar.
3)   The first combat is the party fighting the 4 cultists and the cult leader for survival, after breaking out of bonds and picking up the weapons
4)   After defeating the cultists, the party can loot the cultists for a 50gp ruby, 12 cp, and 40 sp. The cult leader has a silver key on his waist for the chest in the next room
5)   Leaving the room brings you to their operations room, with notes detailing the sacrifice in common, and other books in abyssal talking about [[The Predator]]. The notes detail the plot of how they would report a seawraith haunting [[Lhora]]'s watchtower, and then they would ambush and sacrifice the adventurers who came.

- Party meets an Exterminator, whose a morose, dour man with a long nose and dark eyes. Through him they receive their first contract, mid conversation somebody dumps a flagon of ale on him and call him a shit-slinker, telling him to stop stinking up the bar and to take his stench someone else
