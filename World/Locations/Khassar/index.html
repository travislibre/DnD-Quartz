Acknowledging it out loud will have grave consequences.**\n\nItem Rarity: Rare\nDamage: 1d8+1 (1d10+1 when two-handed)\nDamage Type: Slashing\nRequires Attunement by a Fighter\n\nDescription: The Null Blade is an obsidian black katana, with roiling dark energy flowing across it's edge and a hilt wrapped in golden silk. Wielding the sword is addictive, and one's proclivity to violence is heightened while unsheathed.\n\nBasic Properties: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. \n\nDetermination: While you are attuned to this weapon, any time an attack which would permanently kill you in one shot strikes you, it instead reduces you to one hit point.\n\nSubspace Maw (Reaction): The Null Blade can warp the universe to form a perfect counter to enemy strikes and consume the power behind them. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to slice open a tear in the fabric of reality and absorb the damage. This reaction counts as a magical effect, and can be counterspelled. You can only use this feature once per combat encounter.\n\nCurse: **You cannot tell anyone about this curse.** The Null Blade is deeply cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the katana, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on all attack rolls made with weapons other than this one. Occasionally, you can hear the blade scream with enmity and hate. While the weapon is sheathed, you find your thoughts drift to violence and bloodshed uncomfortably easily. The blade demands discipline and perfection, and you must spend at least 30 minutes training with it each day. If you are able to, and you do not train with the weapon for at least 30 minutes, it might hurt you or an ally in your sleep, even potentially killing them. When you're falling asleep with this blade equipped, you swear you can hear another voice in your thoughts that isn't your own, speaking an unfamiliar language in a low, vengeful thrum.\n\nIf you have any questions about the curse, PM me, don't ask out loud at the table.\n\nCharged Strike: Your next attack with the Null Blade can add the damage absorbed by Subspace Maw (Reaction) to its next damage roll as necrotic damage. \n\nThree Verse Slash: You can unsheathe your weapon faster than light can reach it, and the first attack you make in any encounter is made with advantage and crits on a nat 19 or nat 20.\n\n# Executor's Gunblade\n**DO NOT mention the curse at the table. Acknowledging it out loud will have grave consequences.**\n\nItem Rarity: Rare\nBlade: 1d6 Slashing, Finesse\nGun: 2d6 Piercing, reload 2, misfire 2, Range (25/60)\nRequires Attunement by a Rogue\n\nDescription: The Gunblade is a highly unorthodox but highly effective fusion of old and new. A paradoxical firearm, the gunblade can only hold two shots at a time. Whatever magical property affecting the weapon causes the blade to feel weightless, allowing the weapon to be aimed and fired normally. Even stranger, the weapon can be holstered and quick-drawn like a normal pistol, the barrel and blade somehow collapsing and unfurling much like a telescope. To top it all off, the gunblade changes its appearance to match the user's wishes.\n\nBasic Properties: This gun is a magic firearm that grants a +1 to attack rolls made with it, both melee and ranged. This does not include damage rolls.\n\nQuickdraw: While the Executor's Gunblade is holstered, it's wary of everyone and everything around it, and you add your proficiency modifier to initiative rolls. Additionally, your FIRST attack in each encounter is done with advantage, and the range is temporarily increased to (60/120). \n\nCurse: **You cannot tell anyone about this curse.** The Executor's Gunblade is deeply cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the Gunblade, keeping it within reach at all times, even when sleeping. You have disadvantage on attack rolls with any other firearm. Finally, you feel a sense of dread build up within you if you go too long without scanning your surroundings for enemies. You cannot benefit from a long rest until you search your immediate surroundings for traps or enemies. While in unfamiliar situations, you can feel your paranoia creep up on you, and you swear you can hear panic-stricken thoughts not of your own mind.\n\nIf you have any questions about the curse, ask over discord, don't ask out loud at the table.\n\nBullet-Weaver: When attacking with this weapon, you may choose between using the blade or using the firearm, and may alternate when using multiple attack actions during the same turn (Such as with the *Extra Attack* feature). If you're in melee range, you may also choose to fire as you stab with the blade to make an additional attack roll against any creature in range, disregarding *Extra Attack* if you wish, but the misfire score increases to 5.\n\nDeadeye: You crit on a 19 or 20, and the creature must make a Constitution Saving Throw (DC 10+Dex Mod) or be dazed and suffer disadvantage on its next attack.\n\n# Trident of the Woodlands\n\n**DO NOT mention the curse at the table. Acknowledging it out loud will have grave consequences.**\n\nItem Rarity: Rare\nTrident: 1d8 Piercing\nRequires Attunement by a Druid\n\nDescription: The Trident of the Woodlands is a beautiful, near ornamental trident covered in moss. The prongs and body of the spear are gold, with flowering vines wrapped around the length of the prongs.\n\nProperties: This trident can be wielded as a druidic focus that grants a +1 bonus to Attack rolls made with it. While holding it, you have a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. The trident has max 10 Charges for the following Properties. It regains 1d6+2 expended Charges every long rest. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 3 or lower, the trident will not gain new charges until you kill a sentient creature with it.\n\nSpells: You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the trident's Charges to cast one of the following Spells from it, using your spell save DC: Animal Friendship (1 charge), locate animals or Plants (2 charges), Speak with Animals (1 charge), or speak with Plants (3 charges). \n\nCurse: **You cannot tell anyone about this curse.** The Trident of the Woodlands is deeply cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to sleep alone, and cannot benefit from a long rest unless within 10 feet of an ally. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and spell attack rolls if you've not made contact with an ally for more than a minute. Finally, you feel a sense of dread build up within you when you're not near allies. Sometimes, when you're alone, you think you can hear the Trident sob quietly. No one else hears this.\n\nIf you have any questions about the curse, DM me on insta, don't ask out loud at the table.\n\nBonus: You can also use an action to cast the Pass without Trace spell from the trident (1 charge), but must first physically consume a live animal or insect and draw a runic circle on the earth. This spell only works outdoors, and pauses while indoors or underground.\n  \nTree Form: You can use an action to plant one end of the trident in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to transform the weapon into a healthy tree. The tree is 120 feet tall and has a 15-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 40-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of Transmutation magic if targeted by Detect Magic. The inside of the tree is hollow and furnished like a cozy cabin, with a soft tree-bark couch with cushions, five sheets that can be used as hammocks, and soft magic lights floating around that can be controlled at will. While touching the tree and using another action to speak its Command word, you return the trident to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a trident.",lastmodified:"2022-01-14T01:40:50.802882582Z",title:"!Enchanted Weapons"},"/Monsters-and-Items/Hookshot":{content:"This magic weapon is a favorite among infiltrators. Its firing mechanism has no string, unlike other crossbows. Instead, this weapon can only be loaded with rope. As a bonus action, you can load a length of rope into the crossbow. When you do, individual strands from the rope magically latch onto the weapon's limbs and pull the mechanism taut. You can make a ranged attack with the crossbow to fire the rope at a willing creature or an object within range that isn't being worn or carried. If it hits, the target takes no damage from the attack but is bound by the rope. If the rope is long enough, it magically wraps around the target in a single loop and securely ties itself, leaving the remaining rope to hang from the knot. If the target is a willing creature, the rope ties itself around the creature's chest or waist as a harness but does not restrain them. If the attack hits an unwilling creature, the rope falls harmlessly to the ground without being tied. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check, releasing a bound object within its reach on a success.\n\nThe halfling carried no bolts with him to load his crossbow; only a long stretch of rope hung loosely by his side. In a single, fluid motion, he drew the crossbow and placed the rope in its center, aiming it at the gargoyles on the roof of the duke's estate.

The Salt-wives are led by the Matriach, the oldest woman in the town, who does not vote but moderates debate and occasionally gives advice and wisdom. This democratic matriachy was formed out of necessity, as Lhora was once ravaged by seawraiths hundreds of years prior, with the town being reduced to only it's widows and children.\n\nLhora practices the Ilyric tradition, meaning the use of undead to perform menial labor is commonplace and accepted.

You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what actually gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n🔗 [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](obsidian.md)\n\n### Ignoring Files\nOnly want to publish a subset of all of your notes? Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.\n\n❌ [Excluding pages from being published](ignore%20notes.md)\n\n### Folder Structure\nHere's a rough overview of what's what.\n\n**All content in your garden can found in the `/content` folder.** To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.** This is the home page which is slightly special. You don't need front matter here!\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder. The only caveat is that you should reference them in your Markdown by prefixing it with a `/`.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```markdown",lastmodified:"2022-01-14T01:40:50.870883472Z",title:"Editing Content in Quartz"},"/private/notes/hosting":{content:"---\n\n## GitHub Pages\nQuartz is designed to be effortless to deploy. If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is essentially a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as normal.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`.\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing path.\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n	github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n	publish_dir: ./public  \n	publish_branch: master\n	cname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](hosting.md).\n\n### Do I need a website already?\nNo! Setting up Quartz means you set up a site too :)\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [obsidian](obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder. The only caveat is that you should reference them in your Markdown by prefixing it with a `/`.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.yaml` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!
